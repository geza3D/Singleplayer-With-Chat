# Singleplayer With Chat
 Sometimes people say that playing on anarchy servers far away from spawn is like singleplayer with chat, so this mod just makes the exact thing possible.

## Features
- Sending and recieving messages from the servers in singleplayer
- Getting the tablist of servers in singleplayer

## Usage
### Commands
- /connect \<ip\> - Connects to the server on the given IP.
- /disconnect - If connected to a server it disconnects.
### Useful Things
- By running commands with **//** prefix you can run singleplayer commands, instead of commands on the server.

## CAUTION
 When you connect to a server from singleplayer, you phisically connect to the server with the account you are on. Otherwise chatting wouldn't be possible. Make sure the account you use in singleplayer is in a safe location on the server.
 
 **In addition, I do not take any responsiblity if you get banned from a server while using this.**
